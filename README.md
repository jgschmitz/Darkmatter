# Darkmatter 🚀👽✨

Ever wondered what happens when you mix **MongoDB**, **SETI’s cosmic data**, and the power of the **cloud**?  
Welcome to **Darkmatter** — a side project born from curiosity, caffeine, and a conference deadline.

## 🌌 What is this?

Darkmatter is a **fun implementation project** that takes **huge public datasets from SETI**, loads them into **MongoDB**, and lets you query them at scale.  

And because staring at raw JSON isn’t cool, we also **visualize the data in near real-time with Grafana**.  
Yes, you can literally chart the universe (or at least the parts SETI shares with us).

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Google Cloud Platform** – scalable playground in the sky  
- **MongoDB** – flexible, document-based, and built for big data  
- **Apache Drill** – ad-hoc SQL queries across MongoDB collections in sub-second time  
- **Grafana** – turning cosmic signals into visual stories

## 🚀 What Can You Do?

- Pull in **unlimited amounts of SETI data**  
- Store and query with **MongoDB**  
- Run blazing-fast **sub-second SQL queries** with Apache Drill  
- Visual
